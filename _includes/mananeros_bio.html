Mañaneros was a chilean band. Created on 2011 under the premise of continuous experimentation with different latin rhythms and avant-garde sonic textures. Their biggest influences were peruvian cumbia, tribal guarachero, chilean folk, dub end electronic músic. Most of their workflow in production and influences became the cornerstone of what the label Mañana Records is today. The band took different paths after their 4th album "Chacal", released on 2016.
