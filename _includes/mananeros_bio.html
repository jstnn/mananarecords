Mañaneros was a chilean band. Created on 2011 under the premise of continuous experimentation with different latin rhythms and avant-garde sonic textures. Their biggest influences were peruvian cumbia, tribal guarachero, chilean folk, dub end electronic músic. Most of their workflow in musical production and influences became the cornerstone of what became Mañana Records today. The band decided to end their "musical project" after their 4th album "Chacal", released on 2016, to pursue different artistic paths.
